# Software 2.0, LeToR

Each folder in this Repo has a main.py/main.ipynb file, respective data/result files and a .pdf report describing the Python program. Each folder represents an individual program and has been appropriately named to identify its application. 

* Software 2.0: Program to demonstrate differences between Software 1.0 (following a logical sequence of steps written by programmer) and Software 2.0 (learnt by machine and data-driven from repositories) programming approaches using a simple FizzBuzz program.

* LeToR: Project to demonstrate a data-driven ranking program using Linear regression and Radial Basis Functions.

Note that small variations in results between the main.ipynb file and Report may be present due to random initializations and other randomness introduced during subsequent program runs.
